# Process to run application on Google Colab
1. Upload `Inference.ipynb` on Google Colab. Connect to GPU and run all cells. Copy the URL generated by the third-last cell.
2. Use this URL in `streamlit-app/pages/start_game.py:9`. Only update the base URL and keep the "generate" path as-is.
3. Use a valid OpenAI API key in `streamlit-app/pages/start_game.py:10` which is required for image generation.
4. cd into `streamlit-app` and launch the streamlit application locally using `streamlit run streamlit-dummy.py`.
5. Please be patient the model could take a while to generate responses :(
